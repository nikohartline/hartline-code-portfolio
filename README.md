Code developed for past projects and work

**Anchoveta Web App Folder-** Code for web app made with shiny in R. The app provides a user-friendly introduction to the economics behind policy effects on the Peruvian anchovy fisheries with input options for prices and management strategies. The app can be viewed at https://nikohartline.shinyapps.io/anchoveta_web_app/

**Habitat Destruction and Biodiversity Simulation-** R simulation using data from the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve to model the effects of various habitat destruction regimes on rates of biodiversity loss.

**IUCN Data Mining, Analysis, and Visualization Scripts Folder-** Contains scripts made to obtain and organize data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species. A script for generating ggplot2 graphics in R are also included.

**Patagonia Microfiber Pollution from Machine Washing of Synthetic Garments-** Script of statistical analyses and professional graphics created with ggplot2 for my master's thesis project at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. The code was also modified to generate statistics and graphics for later publishing of the results in the *Environmental Science & Technology* journal. Samples of the work and journal article can be accessed at https://www.nikohartline.com/project/synthetic-microfiber-pollution-from-machine-washing/
